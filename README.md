Autolike.js
===========
A bookmarklet for automatically liking each post on any facebook wall.

Instructions
============
- Copy the code from autolike.js and put it in a bookmark in your bookmarks toolbar
- Go to a facebook page
- Click the bookmarklet and watch as each post is automatically 'liked'!

Features
========
	- Likes links one at a time, with a definable delay between each like (so you don't get banned!)
	- Scrolls the page automatically, so you can see what's happening and this also will load more posts so you can like things forever!
	- Turns each 'like'd link green so you can see it's working

Configuration
=============
	- The default delay is set to 2.0 seconds, which seems to be long enough to no automatically get moderated by the facebook system
	- Change the delay by changing var%20delay=2000 to a different number of milliseconds

Notes
=====
	- Use at your own risk!
	- If you like things too fast facebook will put you on timeout where you will not be able to like anything for up to two days!
